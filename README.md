**Agile in distributed settings** 

Agile is a well-known term in software engineering, but what is it exactly? Based on the article (Abrahamsson et al., 2017), call software development methodology is agile when software development is incremental (small software releases, with rapid cycles), cooperative (customer and developers working constantly together with close communication), straightforward (the method itself is easy to learn and to modify, well documented), and adaptive (able to make last moment changes). 

While lots of companies are adopting agile methodology, globalisation is also taking place in the IT industry. Tight budgets, limited resources, and time constraints have motivated many companies to explore global sourcing (Šmite et al., 2010). As a result, companies could gain more benefits, but also need to face new problems related to communication, coordination, collaboration, etc.

Unfortunately, there is no fixed agile method to apply to distributed setting as of yet due to compatibility issues (Šmite et al., 2010). We can still learn from additional tips suggested by (Phalnikar et al., 2009).
1. Document appropriately whenever necessary.
2. Customer Proxy should interact and communicate well with both technical and business project members.
3. Adjust work schedules to reduce time-related issues coming from the time differences.
4. Use message boards or Wiki instead of email.
 
**Challenges in agile development in a distributed setting** 

There are challenges coming from the distributed environment itself. Distributed settings bring problems such as Strategic issues, Cultural issues, Inadequate communication, Knowledge management, Project and process management issues, Technical issues, and Risk Management (Shrivastava & Date, 2010). 

There are also challenges coming from the compatibility between agile and distributed setting (Shrivastava & Date, 2010). 
1. Documentation: Offshore organizations favor the detailed requirements or designs are sent offshore to be constructed while agile teams tend to downplay documentation.
2. Pair programming: This is not possible in distributed environment.
3. Different working hours: No overlapping working hour can be a problem.
4. Training on teams: It is hard to train new people when it is fully remote. Cultural differences can also make it more difficult.
5. Distribution of work: Work distribution should not take place according to the location.

Besides these issues, there are other challenges such as lack of team cohesion, formal and informal agreement, and so on (Ramesh et al., 2006).

**Common cultural differences in distributed SE development**  
Distributed software engineering comes with the collaboration of people with different cultures and habits. This means that the ability to cover these cultural differences can lead to better understanding within a team..
Hofstede made a distinction of six types of cultural dimensions (Van Solingen, 2022).
* Power distance index: to what level do individuals accept hierarchy and use of powers within the organisation?
* Individualism vs. collectivism: do the employees/individuals in the organisation have a goal together or is it focused on personal goals?
* Masculinity vs. femininity: the level of “toughness” in an organisation and attitude towards sexuality equality
* Uncertainty Avoidance Index: cultures with a high UAI have a low tolerance for uncertainty, are risk-averse and vice versa. 
* Long-term orientation: to what extent is the focus of the organisation and its employers on the long-term horizon?
* Indulgence: focuses on to what level personal needs and the concept of “enjoying life” are accepted in a culture or organisation (Dafoulas & Macaulay, 2002).

Another general cultural difference is language. While English is the standard language, not everyone speaks it fluently. It is possible that people have different interpretations of, for example, written requirements. This can result in various understanding of client’s requirements as a development team relies on written or spoken communication (Patel, Lawson-Johnson & Patel, 2009).

From research it can be concluded that the attitude towards time spent on working and deadlines are opposed to each other. At the start  of a project, people from the Middle-East will spend time getting to know each other, while people from the US are more focused on the deadline and start working quickly with less focus on getting to know their colleagues (Patel, Lawson-Johnson & Patel, 2009). This influences the outcome of the final product as the team did not understand each other from the beginning and thus leads to complexities in communication and collaboration.

**Mitigation of problems caused by cultural differences related to communication, coordination and control**
The socio-technical nature of software development makes interaction complex when culture differs, such as behaviour, beliefs, values and patterns. The paper above contributes twelve practices derived from nineteen different studies provide awareness and understanding of culture to prevent conflict, mistrust and to achieve maximum performance with the available expertise. The paper further proposes specific activity patterns per point for teams to implement in their own work.
1. “Understand and be aware of cultural differences”, improves communication and coordination by understanding the different backgrounds of members and know what behaviour is and isn’t acceptable in different cultures.
2. “Make onsite visits”, as a team building exercise for improving trust and socialisations. This improves communication.
3. “Standardise skills required for global team members”, a diverse team increases understanding, for example by considering language, age, geography and gender. Developer skills and leadership boost control.
4. “Identify and establish the cultural context of each global team”, understanding cultural differences can be the difference in increased creativity and innovation or dispute and confusion.
5. “Provide a cultural training”, to improve awareness and thus improve the other points.
6. “Look out for cultural misunderstanding in requirements”, misinterpretation may cause composed requirements and actual needs to differ. Control of a satisfactory product and communication of needs is improved by looking out for these differences.
7. “Develop and maintain a cultural knowledge base”.
8. “Assign a local manager with the skills needed for a global team”, improves all three c’s. Such a manager can be the connection to enhance communication and coordination, gaining more control over the end result.
9. “Offer english language training sessions”, improves communication.
10. “Plan how to mitigate issues caused by cultural misunderstanding”, planned actions like repositories and distributed reinforcement teams may address potential problems caused by cultural confusion. Common labour practices and team building also mitigate the potential problems.
11. “Prepare for distributed meetings”, document issues beforehand and the results from meetings, focus on open conversations. These methods improve coordination.
12. “Project managers should take into account cultural differences during group exercises”, improve control by preventing misunderstandings and delays.


**Scrum phases affected by cultural differences** 
Agile is a manifesto that is like a compass. One can always adhere to the Agile methodology, by following its principles, no matter the method. One of the agile methods is Scrum. 

Scrum is an empirical approach, that uses a backlog, containing a list of items that need to be implemented. The whole development process consists of sprints which are development cycles. The Sprint consist of Scrum events; in the Sprint planning, the issues that are to be worked in during the sprint are discussed. At the end of each Sprint is the Sprint review and Sprint retrospective. During the review the outcome of the Sprint is inspected and future adaptations are determined. The purpose of the Sprint retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness. Lastly, there are daily scrums during which progress toward the Sprint Goal is inspected and the Sprint Backlog is adapted as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work. 
During each of these cycles cultural differences between teams or individuals in teams can impact the productivity of the method (Scrum. Org, 2022). 

In the following cultural differences are commonly present in distributed SE development Scrum events:
| Scrum event | Cultural difference | Effect | Solution|
|-----|---------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Backlog | Misunderstandings of requirements. | In the worst case the misunderstanding may not have been noticed until the demo. | Product owners have to ask follow-up questions. |
| Daily Scrum   | During the daily scrum meetings, specifically at the beginning of the development, people from an Asian cultures take time to open up and tell about their tasks and impediments. Whereas people from Western cultures are more open (Paasivara, 2008). | This can result in short daily meetings, that take only a couple of minutes | Encourage the team to open up and communicate outside of the the meetings. |
| Sprint planning | Cultural and language differences can cause silence or misunderstandings of some participants. | People from Asian cultures tend to not ask enough. Whereas people from Western cultures see the Sprint planning as an opportunity to transfor business-related knowledge. Furthermore, some cultures tend to speak more directly whereas other cultures prefer to have more small talk (Paasivara, 2013) | Give a possibility for team members from all sites to participate, to ask clarifications, to understand tasks and to commit to common goals. |
